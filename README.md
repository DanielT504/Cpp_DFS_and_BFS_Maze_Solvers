# Cpp_DFS_and_BFS_Maze_Solvers

May 2018

Programs use breadth-first-search (BFS) or depth-first-search (DFS) algorithms
to solve a user-provided maze of ANY size.

Usage: Provide access to apvector and apmatrix classes. Provide access to
text file containing text-based maze ('#' are walls, 'S' is start,
'G' is goal, '.' is open space), with two integer dimensions at
the top of the file (rows, columns).

***NOTE*** Some maze files have been provided, BUT be aware that
some mazes may be too large for your specific computer monitor
(although most should fit if you enlarge the console first).

To run, enter file name and desired speed as prompted.
